              About Me
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600 text-lg">
              My programming journey began when I was 15 years old, back in
              2018, when my father bought me my first PC. That moment sparked my
              curiosity, and I started exploring the world of coding. Over the
              years, I faced numerous challenges trying to establish myself in
              the programming space. I learned a lot but struggled to find my
              place. Everything changed when I discovered Programming Hero. It
              provided me with the structure and guidance I needed to unlock my
              full potential. Through six months of dedication and hard work, I
              transformed my skills and finally achieved my goal of becoming a
              successful MERN stack developer. Now, I want to build profitabel
              and successfull SAAS aoplicaton. Letâ€™s build something amazing
              together! ðŸš€
